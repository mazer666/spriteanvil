# AI Prompt Gallery

Use these prompts with AI image generators (DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) to create base assets for SpriteAnvil.

## 1. Character Sprites
> "Pixel art character sprite, 32x32 pixels, front view, simple color palette, white background, [CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION], thick outlines, clear silhouette."

## 2. Tilesets
> "Pixel art tileset for a [BIOME_NAME] level, 16x16 grid, top-down view, repeatable patterns, high contrast, vivid colors, game asset style."

## 3. Icon Sets
> "Set of 10 pixel art game icons, 16x16 pixels each, fantasy style, includes [LIST_OF_ITEMS], flat lighting, distinct shapes."

## 4. Inpainting / Contextual Generation
When using the in-app AI features (once configured):
- **Repair**: "Fill in this missing part of the pixel art character's arm, matching the existing color palette and line weight."
- **Expand**: "Extend this landscape to the right, adding a small pixel art tree that fits the current style."

## Tips for Best Results
- **Resolution**: Always specify the target resolution (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64).
- **Hard Edges**: Emphasize "no anti-aliasing" or "clean edges" to ensure the results are editable in SpriteAnvil.
- **Palette**: Mention "limited palette" or "NES style" to avoid messy gradients.
